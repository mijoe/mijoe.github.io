Initialize new jekyll project 

---

_**Assistant**_

The Jekyll project has been initialized in your current directory. All necessary files and dependencies have been set up.

Would you like to build or serve the site locally next?

The Jekyll site is now being served locally and is accessible at http://0.0.0.0:4000/. You can preview your site in a browser.

There are some deprecation warnings related to Sass, but the site is running correctly. Let me know if you want to address those warnings or need help with anything else!

There are no `.scss` files in your workspace, which means the Sass source files (where the deprecated `@import`, `lighten`, and `darken` functions are used) are not present locally. These files are part of the `minima` gem, which is used as a theme and managed as a Ruby gem.

To fix the Sass deprecation warnings, you need to override the theme's styles by copying the relevant `.scss` files from the `minima` gem into your project, then update them to use the new `@use` syntax and modern color functions.

Would you like me to guide you through copying and customizing the `minima` theme's Sass files so you can resolve these warnings?
