# What is CNAME? (2025-06-08 21:56:58)

What is CNAME?

---

_**Assistant**_

The CNAME file in your repository specifies custom domain names for your GitHub Pages site. By listing michaeljoerg.com and www.michaeljoerg.com in this file, you tell GitHub Pages to serve your site at these custom domains instead of the default username.github.io address.

_**User**_

Preserve CNAME in all following steps.

---

_**Assistant**_

Understood. I will ensure that the CNAME file and its contents are preserved in all following steps. If any operation could affect the CNAME file, I will take care to keep it unchanged.

_**User**_

Remove the old jekyll site

---

_**Assistant**_

To remove the old Jekyll site while preserving your CNAME file, I will delete all files and folders except for CNAME. This will ensure your custom domain configuration remains intact.

I'll proceed to remove the Jekyll site files and folders, keeping only the CNAME file. The old Jekyll site has been removed, and the CNAME file has been preserved as requested. If you need to add new site files or initialize a new project, let me know how you'd like to proceed.
